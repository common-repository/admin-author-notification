An Admin and Author notification of a submission made by an author but not yet authorised by Admin

== Description ==

I had a client who wanted to notify an author by means of a Javascript alert that their submission had been successfully entered to 'Pending' status and which would also email the Administrator about this new pending submission. I firstly performed this in functions.php but realised it could easily be abstracted to a plugin - which it has :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory on your Wordpress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure you have a working Admin email specified in your 'Settings' in Wordpress.
